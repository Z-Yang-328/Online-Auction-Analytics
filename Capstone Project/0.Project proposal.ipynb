    "### 1. What is the problem you want to solve?\n",
    "    Facebook published online auction data to predict whether a auction was made by human or by robot. In order to correctly predict the identity of the bidder, analysis should be done based on bidder’s behaviors."

    "    When people are making auctions on any websites, they expect that all their opponents are human beings rather than robots. Therefore, online auction websites will punish those robot-bidders to make it a fair auction environment, increasing the customers online auction experience."

    "### 3. What data are you going to use for this? How will you acquire this data?\n",
    "    The data is provided by Facebook and presented as a Kaggle competition. There are two datasets in the competition. One is a bidder dataset that includes a list of bidder information, including their id, payment account, and address. The other is a bid dataset that includes 7.6 million bids on different auctions. The bids in this dataset are all made by mobile devices.The online auction platform has a fixed increment of dollar amount for each bid, so it doesn't include an amount for each bid. You are welcome to learn the bidding behavior from the time of the bids, the auction, or the device.The data in this competition comes from an online platform, not from Facebook.\n",
