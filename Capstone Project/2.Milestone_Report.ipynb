For example, for the bidder dataset, the address and payment_account are features from which we are not able to extra any valuable infomation. These kind of features are also included in bid data set: ip and url. There is one special feature, time in bid data set.

    "* Robot bidders make more bids in average per auction than human bidders. However, how significant the differences are is not the same among all merchandises. For example, for sporting goods, the difference in mean of number of bids between human and robot bidders are significant, which means it can be used to classify if the bidder is a robot bidder.\n",

    "### 5. Based on these findings, what approach are you going to take? How has your approach changed from what you initially proposed, if applicable?\n",
    "* Since most features are not able to be used to build classification models directly, creating and transforming features are needed for getting appropriate predictors. For example, country code and device code should be converted to numeric data(i.e. 0 for us, 1 for japan, etc.). New features like \"average number of bids of a bidder\", \"average number of bids per auction per bidder\" will be created.\n",
    "* Before building models, clustering could be applied to find patterns among all the bids. \n",
